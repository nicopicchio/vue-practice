# Intro to Vue.JS

I decided to start learning Vue as an alternative to React. In this repo I collect all my practice exercises.

## What I learnt so far

- How to create a Vue app and link it to the html file
- Data and templates
- Click events
- Conditional rendering
- Mouse events
- Rendering from arrays
